Forked and adapted from Luke Antins' [resque-lock-timeout v0.4.5][resque-lock-timeout] plugin.

ActiveJob Lock
===================

An [ActiveJob][activejob] plugin that adds locking, with optional timeout/deadlock handling.

Using a `lock_timeout` allows you to re-acquire the lock should your job
fail, crash, or is otherwise unable to release the lock. **i.e.** Your server
unexpectedly loses power. Very handy for jobs that are recurring or may be
retried.

**n.b.** By default, a job that fails to acquire a lock will be dropped. You can handle lock failures by implementing the available [callback](#callbacks).

Usage / Examples
----------------

### Single Job Instance

```ruby
class UpdateNetworkGraph < ActiveJob::Base
  include ActiveJobLock::Core

  queue_as :network_graph

  def perform(repo_id)
    heavy_lifting
  end
end
```

Locking is achieved by storing a identifier/lock key in Redis.

Default behavior...

* Only one instance of a job may execute at once.
* The lock is held until the job completes or fails.
* If another job is executing with the same arguments the job will abort.

Please see below for more information about the identifier/lock key.

### Enqueued Exclusivity (Loner Option)

Setting the `@loner` boolean to `true` will ensure the job is not enqueued if
the job (identified by the `identifier` method) is already running/enqueued.

```ruby
class LonelyJob < ActiveJob::Base
  include ActiveJobLock::Core

  queue_as :loners
  lock loner: true

  def perform(repo_id)
    heavy_lifting
  end
end
```

### Lock Expiry/Timeout

The locking algorithm used can be found in the [Redis SETNX][redis-setnx]
documentation.

Simply set the lock timeout in seconds, e.g.

```ruby
class UpdateNetworkGraph < ActiveJob::Base
  include ActiveJobLock::Core

  queue_as :network_graph
  # Lock may be held for up to an hour.
  lock timeout: 3600

  def perform(repo_id)
    heavy_lifting
  end
end
```

Customize & Extend
==================

### Job Identifier/Lock Key

By default the key uses this format: `lock:<job class name>:<identifier>`.

The default identifier is just your job arguments joined with a dash `-`.

If you have a lot of arguments or really long ones, you should consider
overriding `identifier` to define a more precise or loose custom identifier:

```ruby
class UpdateNetworkGraph < ActiveJob::Base
  include ActiveJobLock::Core

  queue_as :network_graph

  # Run only one at a time, regardless of repo_id.
  def identifier(repo_id)
    nil
  end

  def perform(repo_id)
    heavy_lifting
  end
end
```

The above modification will ensure only one job of class
UpdateNetworkGraph is running at a time, regardless of the
repo_id.

Its lock key would be: `lock:UpdateNetworkGraph` (the `:<identifier>` part is left out if the identifier is `nil`).

You can define the entire key by overriding `redis_lock_key`:

```ruby
class UpdateNetworkGraph < ActiveJob::Base
  include ActiveJobLock::Core

  queue_as :network_graph

  def redis_lock_key(repo_id)
    "lock:updates"
  end

  def perform(repo_id)
    heavy_lifting
  end
end
```

That would use the key `lock:updates`.

### Redis Connection Used for Locking

By default all locks are stored via a Redis client. For that, you have to tell `ActiveJobLock`
which client it should use. Set that through an initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/active_job_lock.rb

ActiveJobLock::Config.redis = Redis.new(redis_config)
```

If you want, you can then override it per job instance by doing:

```ruby
class UpdateNetworkGraph < ActiveJob::Base
  include ActiveJobLock::Core

  queue_as :network_graph

  def lock_redis
    @lock_redis ||= CustomRedis.new
  end

  def perform(repo_id)
    heavy_lifting
  end
end
```

### Setting Timeout At Runtime

You may define the `lock_timeout` method to adjust the timeout at runtime
using job arguments. e.g.

```ruby
class UpdateNetworkGraph < ActiveJob::Base
  include ActiveJobLock::Core

  queue_as :network_graph

  def lock_timeout(repo_id, timeout_minutes)
    60 * timeout_minutes
  end

  def perform(repo_id, timeout_minutes = 1)
    heavy_lifting
  end
end
```

### Helper Methods

* `locked?` - checks if the lock is currently held.
* `enqueued?` - checks if the loner lock is currently held.
* `loner_locked?` - checks if the job is either enqueued (if a loner) or locked (any job).
* `refresh_lock!` - Refresh the lock, useful for jobs that are taking longer
    then usual but your okay with them holding on to the lock a little longer.

### <a name="callbacks"></a> Callbacks

Several callbacks are available to override and implement your own logic, e.g.

```ruby
class UpdateNetworkGraph < ActiveJob::Base
  include ActiveJobLock::Core

  queue_as :network_graph
  lock timeout: 3600, loner: true

  # Job failed to acquire lock. You may implement retry or other logic.
  def lock_failed(repo_id)
    raise LockFailed
  end

  # Unable to enqueue job because its running or already enqueued.
  def loner_enqueue_failed(repo_id)
    raise EnqueueFailed
  end

  # Job has complete; but the lock expired before we could release it.
  # The lock wasn't released; as its *possible* the lock is now held
  # by another job.
  def lock_expired_before_release(repo_id)
    handle_if_needed
  end

  def perform(repo_id)
    heavy_lifting
  end
end
```
